MetaEmployees is dedicated to learning more about the Meta Product, Design, Engineering, and Growth teams using SQL.

The Meta Queries file contains SQL commands querying data to answer questions about the teams. 
The Queries and Results file shows the SQL command along with the result, limited to 10 records for space purposes.
